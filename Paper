Overview
NEUROMESH is a revolutionary federated learning platform that enables healthcare institutions to collaboratively train Al models while maintaining complete data privacy. Built on the Hedera blockchain, ti ensures secure, consensus-driven model updates without exposing sensitive patient data.
Key Features
• E Privacy-First: Patient data never leaves the local hospital
• & Encrypted Updates: Al model updates are encrypted before blockchain submission • $8 Hedera Integration: Leverages Hedera Consensus Service for trust and transparency • ® Federated Learning: Colaborative Al training across multiple institutions
• l Real-time Monitoring: Live dashboard for training progress and network status
• E Consensus-based: Democratic model aggregation through blockchain consensus
